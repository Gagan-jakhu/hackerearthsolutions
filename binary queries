/*

Some problems appear hard though they are very easy. Today Aakash is stuck in a range query problem. He has been given an array with only
numbers 0 and 1. There are two types of queries -

0 L R : Check whether the number formed from the array elements L to R is even or odd and print EVEN or ODD respectively. Number formation is 
the binary number from the bits status in the array L to R

1 X : Flip the Xth bit in the array 

Indexing is 1 based

Input
First line contains a number N and Q as input. Next line contains N space separated 0 or 1. Next Q lines contain description of each query 

Output
Output for only query type 0 L R whether the number in range L to R is "EVEN" or "ODD" (without quotes).

Constraints
1≤ N ≤ 10^6 
1≤ L ≤ R ≤ 10^6 
1≤ Q ≤ 10^6

1≤ X ≤ N

SAMPLE INPUT 
5 2
1 0 1 1 0
1 2
0 1 4
SAMPLE OUTPUT 
ODD
Explanation
Our first query is 1 2 that means that we have to flip the 2nd bit in the given array so now our array becomes 1 1 1 1 0
2nd query is 0 1 4 which means that if i pick the subarray 1 to 4 i.e 1 1 1 1 then the number formed by decimal representation of this binary
number is of what kind ?. Here the number formed is 15 so its odd and ODD is the output
