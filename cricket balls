Now, Daksh has to go for practicing to cricket ground to compete in the upcoming fest URJA. Daksh wants to carry exactly K number of cricket
balls to ground and he can carry only 2 boxes. Can you tell him the number of ways in which he can select 2 boxes such that total number of 
cricket balls in them is K.

Input :

First line of the input is the number of test cases T.
Each test case has 3 lines. First line is the number of boxes N.
Next line has N space separated integers where the ith integer is the number of cricket balls in the ith box.
3rd line of each test case contains value of K.
Output:

For each test case, output a single number, the number of ways in which Daksh can select the boxes.
Constraints:

1<=T<=100
1<=N<=105
1<=Number of Balls in ith box<=100
