/*
Sumit is doing research in mathematics . After doing lots of research, he struck in a problem . He found four numbers n,a, b and c .Now, 
he wants to know how many number exists which are less than or equal to n and are divisible by a ,b or c .

Input :

First line contains 't' denoting numbers of test cases
Next t lines contains 4 integers denoting n,a,b and c separated by space
Output :

't' lines containing the count of the numbers which are divisible by a,or b, or c
Constraints :

1<=t<=10^5
1<=n<=10^9
1<=a,b,c<=10^5
SAMPLE INPUT 
1
15 2 3 5
SAMPLE OUTPUT 
11
Explanation
Here n = 15 , a= 2, b=3,c = 5 The number which are divisible by a ,b, or c are 2,3,4,5,6,8,9,10,12,14,15 i.e 11 numbers , so output is 11
