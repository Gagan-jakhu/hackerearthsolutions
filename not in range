/*
You are given 10^6 boxes that are numbered from 1 to 10^6. The value of each box is equal to its number. 
There are N ranges and every range consists of two integers L  and R  denoting that the value of box in the range [L,R] will turn out to be zero. 
Find the sum of values of all boxes from 1 to 10^6 .

Note: The ranges may overlap.

Input format

First line: Integer N
Next N lines: Two space-separated integers L and R  
Output format
Print a single integer denoting the answer.

Constraints
0≤N≤10^5
1≤L≤R≤10^6

SAMPLE INPUT 
5
2 20
23 200
21 21
101 2000
2002 999998
SAMPLE OUTPUT 
2002023
Explanation
Boxes having number 1, 22, 2001, 999999,1000000 does not belong to any range.
So the sum of these numbers is 2002023 which is our answer.
