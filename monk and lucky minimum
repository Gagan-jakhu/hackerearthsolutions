/* 
Monk just purchased an array A having N integers. Monk is very superstitious. He calls the array A Lucky if the frequency of the minimum
element is odd, otherwise he considers it Unlucky. Help Monk in finding out if the array is Lucky or not.

Input:
First line consists of a single integer T denoting the number of test cases.
First line of each test case consists of a single integer N denoting the size of array A.
Second line of each test case consists of N space separated integers denoting the array A.

Output:
For each test case, print "Lucky" (without quotes) if frequency of minimum element is odd, otherwise print "Unlucky"(without quotes).
Print a new line after each test case.

Constraints: 
1≤T≤10
1≤N≤105
1≤A[i]≤109

SAMPLE INPUT
