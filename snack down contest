/*
You and your roommate are teammates in SNACKDOWN competition. There are N questions in SNACKDOWN round numbered from 1 to N.  You can do some
particular P questions while your roommate can do some particular Q questions. 
Now the question is will your team be able to solve all the N questions if you work together? 

Constraints:

1<=T<=100
1<=N<=100
Input Format- 

First line of input contains number of test cases, T.
First line of each test case contains the integer N.
Second line of each test case contains the integer P then followed by P distinct space seperated integers integers a1, a2,..,ap (1<=ai<=N) 
which denote the questions you can solve.
Second line of each test case contains the integer Q followed by Q distinct integers which denote the questions your roommate can solve in the
same format as above line.
It's assumed that levels are numbered from 1 to N.

Output Format - 

For every test case print "YES" (without quotes) if your team will be able to solve all the N questions, otherwise print "NO" (without quotes)
in a new line.
